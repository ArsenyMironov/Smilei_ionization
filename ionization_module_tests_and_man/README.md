The usage of new ionization modules is illustrated by a small 1D simulation of laser interaction with a thin layer of initially neutral Ar in the middle of the box.

To run the simulation, type in the terminal 'python3 run_test.py'.

The script will automatically run the namelist 'input.py' and analyse the simulation. The input file contains 4 species of Ar with different ionization models. After the simulation finishes, the script will generate several figures with the time dependence for different ion numbers as a function of time for each ionization model.

The functions introduced in run_test.py also allow a direct comparison of the ion curves for different models.
